This will serve as a log of what I have learned, practiced & completed along with what day of the coding challange I am on.

## Day 1/100
### Date: 23/07/2022
- Installed C++ compilers and set them up to work in VScode.
  - G++ & Clang from Mingw.
  - MSVC.
- Ran my first C++ code that printed out *Hello World!*
- Learned about comments in C++:
  - Single line: //
  - Multi-line: /* */
- Using *std::cout* to output values.
- Using *std::endl* to go down to a new line while outputting values.
- Completed a task on Code Wars, it may be too early to do this however as I do not know a lot.  
Looking at solutions may be helpful for now to see how things may be completed but I have to   
starting figuring out solutions for myself soon. 

## Day 2/100
