This will serve as a log of what I have learned, practiced & completed along with what day of the coding challange I am on.

## Day 1/100
### Date: 23/07/2022
- Installed C++ compilers and set them up to work in VScode.
  - G++ & Clang from Mingw.
  - MSVC.
- Ran my first C++ code that printed out *Hello World!*
- Learned about comments in C++:
  - Single line: //
  - Multi-line: /* */
- Using *std::cout* to output values.
- Using *std::endl* to go down to a new line while outputting values.
- Completed a task on Code Wars, it may be too early to do this however as I do not know a lot.  
Looking at solutions may be helpful for now to see how things may be completed but I have to   
starting figuring out solutions for myself soon. 

## Day 2/100
### Date: 24/07/2022
- Worked on an issue I am having with running the C++ compiler in subfolders of the workspace in VScode.  
I have not yet found a solution, the error is that the compiler is looking for a .cpp file in the main folder rather than the file being used in the subfolder.
- Went through a few Python code wars tasks to keep my problem solving and coding skills active.

## Day 3/100
### Date: 26/07/2022
- Learned about functions and statements.
- Realised the difference between defining and calling functions in C++ and Python, functions must be defined outside main function before being called.
- Format of parameters used in function definition must be defined.
- Began learning about Input/Outputs.

## Day 4/100
### Date: 28/07/2022
- Continued with Input/Output section.
- Learned how the execution and memory storage of C++ programs work.

## Day 5/100
### Date: 03/08/2022
- Quickly ran though core, standard library and STL of C++.
- Learned about variables & data types.
  - Different types of vairable.
  - 8 byte equals 1 bit.
- Learned about number system:
  - Binary, octal & hexadecimal.

## Day 6/100
### Date: 07/08/2022
- 4 Kata training pieces of code.
- Mainly on "fundamentals" with Python.
- I don't feel like I have enough knowledge of C++ to complete katas in this language yet.
